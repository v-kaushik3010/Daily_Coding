---

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return *the distance of the nearest* `0` *for each cell*.

The distance between two cells sharing a common edge is `1`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,0]]
```

**Example 2:**

![image](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/24/01-2-grid.jpg)

```
Input: mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
Output: [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,2,1]]
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= m * n <= 10^4`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.
- There is at least one `0` in `mat`.
